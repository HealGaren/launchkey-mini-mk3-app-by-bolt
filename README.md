# MIDI Controller Interface

A sophisticated MIDI controller interface built with React and TypeScript, developed entirely through AI pair programming with Bolt.new at [bolt.new](https://bolt.new). This project serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development capabilities and modern web technologies.

## Overview

This web application provides a complete interface for MIDI controller interaction, featuring:

- Real-time MIDI input/output handling
- Visual keyboard with chord detection
- Customizable pad modes (Session/Drum)
- Configurable button colors and behaviors
- Performance optimization with throttling
- Comprehensive MIDI message history

## Technical Stack

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
